# Metta(Metta-type-talk) Programming Language: List and Binary Tree Operations

## Description
This repository contains definition of Binary tree and list data structures and implementations of various operations for lists and binary trees in the Metta programming language.

## List Operations
The List.metta file includes the following functionalities:

1. List Definition: Defining the List type with Nil for an empty list and Cons for a list node.
2. Append Function: Appending an element to the end of the list.
3. Push Function: Pushing an element to the end of the list.
4. is-member Function: Checking if an element is in the list.
5. Remove Element Function: Removing a specified element from the list.
6. Remove Duplicates Function: Removing duplicate elements from the list.
7. Length Function: Calculating the length of the list.
8. Reverse Function: Reversing the list.
9. Map Function: iterating over every member of the list and applying transformer function.
10. Sorting Function: Sorting the list in ascending order.
11. Filter Function: filtering a list based on a condition.
12. foldl and foldr Function: iterating over a list form the left/right and doing an operation to accumulate into a single result.
13. Pop Function: removing the last element of the list.
14. min and max value Function: finding the min/max value of the list

## Binary Tree Operations
The Binary_tree.metta file includes the following functionalities:

1. Binary Tree Definition: Defining the BinaryTree type with Nil for an empty tree and Node for a tree node.
2. Insert Function: Inserting a value into the binary tree.
3. Search Function: Searching for a value in the binary tree

## Usage

copy and paste the codes into playground of metta documentation site
- first copy and paste the definition of the data structures and operation to find head and tail or head, lef and right
- then copy each operation one by one and see the results
